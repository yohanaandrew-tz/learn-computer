            <h2>Introduction to Computer</h2>
            <p id="dfn1">The word <b>Computer</b> is derivered from the word <b>Compute.</b> Compute means to calculate. Computer originally was
            defined as a super calculator. It has the capacity to solve the complex arithmetic and scientific problems at very high speed.
            But nowadays in addition to handling complex arithmetic computations, Computer perferm many tasks like accepting, sorting, selecting
            and comparing various type of informations. They also perform arithmetic and logical operations on alphabetic, numeric and other type of informations</p>
            <p id="dfn2">Therefore <b>Computer</b> is an <i>electronic device</i>, oparating under the control of instructions stored in instructions
            in its own memory, that can <i>accept data</i>(input), <i>process</i> them according to specified rules, <i>produce</i>(output) and store 
            the results(storage) for future use.</b></p>

            <h4>Components of the Computer</h4>
            <p>The Computer Components are divided into two main types namely, <i>Hardware</i> and <i>Software:</i></p>
            <p><b>(a)Hardware</b> is the touchable parts of the Compuer like Keyboard, mouse, monitor and Central processing unit(CPU). 
                Components also are diveded into for categories which are input, processing,output and storage devices.</p>
                <p>The following are the main Hardware components of the Compuer system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Mouse:</b> is  movable input devicce that lets you control a range of things on a Compuer. Most tyepes of mouse have two buttons ,
                        and some will have wheel in between the buttons. Most type of mouse connect to the Computer with a Cable, and mouse use 
                        computer's power to work.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>Monitor:</b> is an output devicce that displays pictures, text, icons and othe information of the Compuer
                    </li>
                    <img src="images/Monitor.jpg" width="60%" alt="Monitor image"><br><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Keyboard:</b> is an input device used for putting information including letters, words and numbers. 
                        You press the individual buttons when you type. 
                    </li>
                    <img src="images/Keyboard.jpg" width="75%" alt="Keyboard image"><br><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Central Processing Unit(CPU):</b> is the processing devicce that acts as the brain of the Computer, cointaining all 
                        the circuitry needed to process input, store data and output results. It contained in the <b>System Unit</b> of the 
                        Computer.
                    </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Storage devices:</b> Including Hard Drive Disks, Floppy Disks, Compact Disks, USB Flash Drive, Solid state Drives(SSD)
                            , Tapes and others.
                        </li>

                    <b>(b)Software:</b> is  the set of Computer programs and associated documents and data. This is in contrast to hardware, 
                    from which the system is built and which actually performs the work. Software is divided into two types namely, Application 
                    system and System software.<br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Application software:</b> It include all Computer program designed to carry out a specific task other than one 
                            relating to the operation of the Computer itself, typically to be used by end-users. Word processors, media players, are 
                            examples of Application Software.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>System software:</b> is the software designed to provide a platform for other user software. Example of system software 
                            include systems like macOS, Linux, Android and Microsoft Windows.
                        </li>
